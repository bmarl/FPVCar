Tire - Is the tire for printing in TPU or similar, or for creating own molds.
TireMold - Tire mold for casting silicon tires.
TireMoldHelper - An additional part to make casting easier
Each tire needs ca. 25g of silicone + ca. 5g for waste if you use the helper, likely more without the helper.

Charger - Charging station. Needs Spring contact
Chassis - Core chassis. Should be printed in ABS, PETG or similar since it uses M3 threads.
Lid - Lid for Chassis. Clip on for temporary use, M3 sunk screws for permanent use.
DOF-Lid - Same as Lid but with additonal mount holes for 9 DOF module.
Hub-Hex - Wheel hub with hexagonal hole. Matches Reifen.
Hub-Hex-Special - Special version of Hub for use with older tires, does not match current tire.
StackHolder - Mount for electronics stack.
Motor-Mount - Chassis extensions to mount the motors and attach the wheels.

Sorry for the large STL files, they are created using volume modeling at 0.1mm resolution, thus the many polygons.
The original modeling was done in Cinema 4D, anyone interested in the C4D files please contact me.
